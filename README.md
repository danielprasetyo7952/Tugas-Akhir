## Methods
Methods that are implemented in the thesis:
- LSTM Model
- Genetic Algorithms for Optimization
<!-- - Particle Swarm Optimization (Future Research) -->

## Usage
1. To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine
2. Install the dependencies from `requirements.txt` file with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. After all dependencies are installed, you can run the notebook

**<ins>Note :</ins>**
It should be noted that I am using **Python Version 3.9**, so if some dependencies cannot be installed then you should install **Python Version 3.9**

## Future Plan
- [ ] Use Streamlit to create the model GUI
